# URGENT: Restart Dev Server

## Problem
The Prisma client was regenerated with the `romaji` field, but Next.js is still using the old cached version without it.

## Solution

**You MUST restart your Next.js development server:**

1. **Stop the current dev server:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `npm run dev`

2. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Or if using a different command:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   next dev
   ```

## Why This is Necessary

Next.js caches the Prisma client in memory. Even though we regenerated it, the running dev server is still using the old version. Restarting forces it to load the new client with the `romaji` field.

## What Happens After Restart

✅ The `romaji` field will be recognized
✅ Word bank operations will work
✅ Japanese lessons will store romaji properly
✅ 500 errors will be resolved

## Current Status

- ✅ Database has `romaji` column
- ✅ Prisma schema includes `romaji` field  
- ✅ Prisma client regenerated successfully
- ❌ Next.js still using old cached client
- ⚠️ **RESTART REQUIRED**

## After Restart

Test by:
1. Go to a Japanese lesson
2. Start the conversation
3. Check terminal - should see no Prisma errors
4. Words should be saved with romaji included
