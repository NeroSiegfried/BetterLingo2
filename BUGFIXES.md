# BetterLingo - Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Lesson Roadmap - Lines and Spacing
**Problem**: No connecting lines between lessons, circles too far apart on desktop screens

**Solution**:
- Added SVG curved lines between lesson circles
- Lines are colored green for completed lessons, gray for locked lessons
- Reduced spacing between lessons from 140px to 120px
- Added max-width container (max-w-md) to keep lessons aligned
- Calculated exact pixel positions for curved paths
- Lines now properly connect lesson circles

**Files Modified**:
- `components/LessonRoadmap.tsx`

### 2. Bottom Navigation Bar Missing
**Problem**: Bottom navbar disappeared on word bank and profile pages

**Solution**:
- Added BottomNav component to word bank page
- Added bottom navigation to profile page (inline implementation to avoid SSR issues)
- Moved Practice button above the bottom nav on word bank page
- Added proper padding-bottom to prevent content overlap
- Bottom nav only hidden in lessons (as specified)

**Files Modified**:
- `app/word-bank/[languageId]/page.tsx`
- `app/profile/page.tsx`

### 3. Voice Lesson Bottom Bar Design
**Problem**: Bottom navbar was too wide and didn't follow specification

**Solution**:
- Completely redesigned the bottom area
- Created SVG curved path that "houses" the microphone button
- Bar curves around button and returns to normal width
- Microphone button is properly positioned in the curve
- Button size: 80px diameter (w-20 h-20)
- Curved navbar follows the specification exactly

**Files Modified**:
- `app/lesson/[languageId]/[lessonId]/voice/page.tsx`

### 4. Chat Bubble Stems
**Problem**: Text boxes didn't have smooth stems, used CSS clip-path hack

**Solution**:
- Replaced clip-path with SVG stems
- Created beautiful curved tails for chat bubbles
- User messages (right): Blue curved stem pointing right
- AI messages (left): White curved stem pointing left with border
- Stems use quadratic Bezier curves for smooth appearance
- Bubbles now have proper rounded corners

**Files Modified**:
- `app/lesson/[languageId]/[lessonId]/page.tsx`

### 5. Course Accumulation
**Problem**: Courses didn't accumulate - switching from English to Spanish removed English

**Solution**:
- Implemented localStorage to persist user courses
- `userCourses` array now stores all enrolled languages
- New language automatically added when user visits course page
- Current language stored separately for navigation
- CourseDropdown shows all user's courses
- Courses persist across page refreshes

**Files Modified**:
- `app/course/[languageId]/page.tsx`

### 6. Flag Display
**Problem**: Flags were just emoji characters in circles, not actual flag images

**Solution**:
- Added `flagUrl` property to language objects using flagcdn.com API
- Replaced emoji with actual flag images
- Images use `object-cover` to crop flags centered in circles
- Updated all components to use flag images:
  - Courses selection page
  - Course dropdown
  - All circular flag displays
- Configured Next.js to allow external images from flagcdn.com

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/languages.ts`
- `app/courses/page.tsx`
- `components/CourseDropdown.tsx`
- `next.config.js`

## Technical Details

### SVG Paths Used

#### Lesson Roadmap Lines
```jsx
<path
  d={`M ${startX} ${startY} Q ${controlX} ${midY}, ${endX} ${endY}`}
  stroke={strokeColor}
  strokeWidth="3"
  strokeDasharray="8,8"
  fill="none"
/>
```

#### Chat Bubble Stems
```jsx
// User message stem (right)
<path 
  d="M 0,0 Q 10,0 15,10 Q 20,20 0,20 Z" 
  fill="#3B82F6"
/>

// AI message stem (left)
<path 
  d="M 0,0 Q 10,0 15,10 Q 20,20 0,20 Z" 
  fill="white"
  stroke="#E5E7EB"
  strokeWidth="1"
/>
```

#### Voice Lesson Curved Navbar
```jsx
<path
  d="M 0,25 L 150,25 Q 200,25 200,70 Q 200,25 250,25 L 400,25 L 400,100 L 0,100 Z"
  fill="white"
  stroke="#e5e7eb"
  strokeWidth="1"
/>
```

### LocalStorage Implementation

```typescript
const [userCourses, setUserCourses] = useState<string[]>(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    const stored = localStorage.getItem('userCourses');
    const courses = stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : [];
    if (!courses.includes(languageId)) {
      courses.push(languageId);
      localStorage.setItem('userCourses', JSON.stringify(courses));
    }
    localStorage.setItem('currentLanguage', languageId);
    return courses;
  }
  return [languageId];
});
```

### Flag Image Configuration

**Language Object**:
```typescript
{
  id: 'spanish',
  name: 'Spanish',
  flag: 'ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸',  // Kept for fallback
  countryCode: 'ES',
  flagUrl: 'https://flagcdn.com/w80/es.png'
}
```

**Next.js Config**:
```javascript
images: {
  remotePatterns: [
    {
      protocol: 'https',
      hostname: 'flagcdn.com',
    },
  ],
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Lesson roadmap shows curved dotted lines
- [x] Lines change color based on completion status
- [x] Lessons stay properly spaced on all screen sizes
- [x] Bottom nav appears on word bank page
- [x] Bottom nav appears on profile page
- [x] Practice button positioned above bottom nav
- [x] Voice lesson has curved navbar around mic button
- [x] Mic button is proper size relative to navbar
- [x] Chat bubbles have smooth curved stems
- [x] User messages have right-pointing stems
- [x] AI messages have left-pointing stems
- [x] Multiple courses accumulate correctly
- [x] Switching between courses works
- [x] Courses persist after refresh
- [x] Flag images load correctly

- [x] All flag icons updated throughout app

## Known Limitations

- LocalStorage is used for persistence (no backend yet)
- Flag images require internet connection
- Course data not synced with backend
- No error handling for failed flag image loads

## Future Improvements

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Store user courses in database
   - Sync across devices
   - Add offline support

2. **Flag Images**
   - Add fallback for offline mode
   - Consider bundling common flags
   - Add loading states

3. **Animations**
   - Smooth transitions for roadmap lines
   - Animated lesson unlock
   - Loading states for course switching

4. **Accessibility**
   - Add aria-labels to SVG elements
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works
   - Test with screen readers

## Performance Notes

- SVG paths are performant and scale well
- Flag images are lightweight (80px width)
- LocalStorage operations are fast
- No noticeable performance impact from changes
